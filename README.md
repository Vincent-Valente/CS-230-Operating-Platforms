# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client was The Gaming Room. They had a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android. They wanted to improve functionality and expand to other platforms. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

While developing this documentation I was able to relay all changes I wanted to make clearly, while explaining why they would be beneficial. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

The design document was helpful in keeping a clear, organized path for any important tasks. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

One part of the document to revise would be the recomendations due to the fact that it was the first time I was directly recomending specific things to a company. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

By spliting up what functionality the game already had into pieces, there was more time to expand to other platforms. It is also very important to consider the user's needs when designing becuase they are the ones who will be using your product. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Splitting the project up into smaller pieces helped me focus on one part at a time, while also making and potential future updates easier to manage.
